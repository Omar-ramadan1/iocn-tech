Hello,
in this project , i have decided to make it in 3 architecture patterns,
 (mvc - bloc pattern - bloc pattern with clean architecture),
 you may wonder why i have decided this kind of decision,
let me explain 
based on our last interview , while i was explaining how i organize the progect,
i noticed that you didn't get me well ,
that's why i take this kind of decesion and also to show  my flexibility because i 
don't know what's the main architecture pattern that you use,

the project seperate to 4 main folders

*common_widget = for the common widget in our app
*modules = that represent the views,
*utlis = that represent the main features of app and any thing relate to it's utilities
*core = that represent the core features that i use and core features that i need in type  of app(that connect to serever)

so according to modules , there's 3 modules

login =>  that module i have made using mvc architecture(Model View Controller)
branches => that module i have made using bloc architecture(Business Logic Component)
products => that module i have made using bloc - clean architecture(Data - Domain - presentation)

packages that i have used
geolocator: => for getting user's location 
google_maps_flutter: => to show the branches on google map with it's details
shared_preferences: => to retrieve the data that i want to hold
flutter_bloc: => as state management but app was too small to use state management
get_it : => to access the same instance of class just as static word in flutter_bloc

i hope you enjoy reviewing the code , and sorry in case of there's an error in ui i didn't test it in all andriod devices
because of the time  and i gave more concern to the logic and finctions.

according to the cart item , the time didn't save me for that i have started the project late because my schedule this week n't pretty good, but i have implement it in severals project that i can show you.

please if you noticed any bad practice or glitch in my code , i would be happy to be 
informed to improve my skills,

looking forward to your feedback,
